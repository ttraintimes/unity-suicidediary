// Version 1.0 //////////////////////////////////////////////////

Thanks for purchasing Frozen Fortress from the Unity Asset Store.

The demo level is located in scenes/Example_01
An overview of several props is located in scenes/PropZoo

All usable assets are located in Art/Prefabs and subfolders

The pack utilizes some custom shaders in Art/Shaders
-FlagWaving // Flag moving in wind
-SnowWorldDirection // Apply snow to surfaces
-SnowWorldDirectionLite // Apply less snow to surfaces
-SnowWorldDirectionMin // Apply minimal snow to surfaces

Custom scripts utilized:
CreatePrefab - select several objects, and in the top taskbar click on "GameObject/Construct Prefab From Parts", they will be added to an empty object
ScrollTexture - used for moving clouds

Please import Standard Assets -
The level will look best if you utilize ambient occlusion, antialiasing, and tonemapping
